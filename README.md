## About

An arch docker container with all my [dotfiles](https://github.com/coma64/dotfiles)
and some of the programms I use on a daily basis.
Thought this might come in handy at some point.

Had the idea when i stumbled upon [pwnbox](https://github.com/superkojiman/pwnbox).

## TODO

- Add lite branch with a less bloated container
- Add docker hub repo
- Switch to the official docker [build-push-action](https://github.com/docker/build-push-action)
